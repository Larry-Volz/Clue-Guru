# Clue-Guru
##Escape room clue-giving app
Clue Guru is an app that I put together for my mobile escape room business.  It enabled players to pick what items they 
wanted to get hints about during a game without asking help from the game master.  It has timers on it that are set with the passwords.
The first password is actually just the playtime.  We would generally use 30 or 45 minute games for the mobile rooms.
The second password is how long they had to wait before they could start getting hints.  Generally I would say 10-15 minutes.
Only the first 3-4 games are set up but they worked well enough that if an employee called in sick one person could run more rooms.  
It needs some work still.  I was still fairly new to Javascript when I wrote it.  Some of the fixes I'd like to get done or would 
love help with.
- the display of the timer isn't as responsive as the rest of hte page and can get to small or vanish on some small phones
- it doesn't save data if refreshed.  I know how to use localStorage but haven't gotten around to updating this 
- Later I'd like to have players sign in, save contact info in a MySQL db for re-marketing purposes and to help them store their
scores to compare with other players
